# fashion MNIST neural networks transfer learning
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the Fashion MNIST data set then after that I am doing classification on it using transfer learning by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. using transfer learning techniques to do classification.
